<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Single-Phase Current Relays Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Under-Current Detection</li><li>Over-Current Detection</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The single-phase current relays market is categorized into two main types: under-current detection and over-current detection. Under-current detection relays monitor the current levels to ensure they do not fall below a predefined threshold, protecting equipment from damage due to insufficient power. In contrast, over-current detection relays are designed to interrupt the current flow when levels exceed safe limits, preventing overheating and potential failures. Both types play crucial roles in maintaining operational efficiency and safety in electrical systems.</p></p>
