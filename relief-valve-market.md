<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Relief Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spring-Type</li><li>Lever-Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The relief valve market encompasses various designs, primarily focusing on spring-type and lever-type valves. Spring-type relief valves utilize a spring to maintain a predetermined pressure setting, releasing excess pressure by opening when the limit is exceeded. In contrast, lever-type relief valves operate through a mechanical lever system, allowing for manual adjustments and greater control over pressure release. Both types serve crucial roles in safeguarding equipment and ensuring operational safety across industries by preventing overpressure situations.</p></p>
